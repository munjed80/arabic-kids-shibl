# Final checkpoint exam

## Purpose
The final checkpoint is a single, calm readiness check after completing Levels 1–20. It validates comfort with letters, words, sentences, and a short paragraph using the same child-safe activity types already in the app. It does not unlock content, gate progress, or change level status.

## Why no grades
- Young learners benefit from gentle, qualitative feedback instead of scores.
- No percentages, timers, or pass/fail states reduce pressure.
- Results are saved only as the latest snapshot on the device (no history, no timestamps).

## How parents should read results
- Each section shows one of three ratings: **strong**, **good**, or **needs practice**.
- Use the ratings to decide what to revisit:
  - **Strong**: maintain practice; move on when ready.
  - **Good**: add light review in daily reading.
  - **Needs practice**: repeat short activities for that section and read together calmly.
- Retry anytime; each attempt overwrites the previous snapshot so the view stays simple.
