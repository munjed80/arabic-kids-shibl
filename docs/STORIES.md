# Story Track: Short Arabic Stories

The short stories track gives learners a calm place to apply the decoding and comprehension skills they built across Levels 11–20. Stories are optional, replayable, and do not affect lesson or assessment progression. Each story has three short paragraphs made of 2–4 word sentences so learners can enjoy fluent reading without pressure.

## How stories differ from lessons
- Stories have no quizzes, scores, or locks. They only reuse gentle "listen" and "review" style reading.
- Text appears one paragraph at a time with large Arabic script and an optional listen button.
- Progress in lessons and assessments stays unchanged; stories do not gate content and remain replayable.

## Why stories come after assessments
- Assessments confirm readiness for connected text; stories then provide meaningful yet low-stakes practice.
- Learners experience whole-paragraph reading with familiar vocabulary, reinforcing confidence from the assessment cycle.
- Parents and educators can offer stories as a reward or cool-down without restarting the structured lesson flow.
