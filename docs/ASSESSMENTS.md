## Child-Safe Assessment Track

### Purpose and philosophy
- Provide a gentle snapshot of reading skills (letters, words, sentences, paragraphs) without pressure.
- Keep retries unlimited and calm so the child can try again immediately.
- Preserve confidence: no timers, no locks, and the companion stays non-verbal.

### Why no grades or percentages?
- Numbers can feel evaluative and discouraging; qualitative phrases like "strong" or "needs practice" keep focus on progress.
- Parents get a quick view without comparing attempts or keeping history.
- The last summary only is stored locally; nothing is uploaded or timestamped.

### How parents should read the results
- Letters, Words, Sentences, Paragraphs each show one phrase (strong / good / needs practice).
- Use the phrase as a gentle nudge: replay an assessment or revisit matching lessons if needed.
- Because only the latest summary is kept, treat it as a snapshot, not a record.
