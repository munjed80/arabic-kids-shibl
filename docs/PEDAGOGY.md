# Arabic Literacy Pedagogy – Mandatory Rules

This document defines the non-negotiable pedagogical rules for teaching Arabic letters to children.
Any lesson, exam, story, or activity that violates these rules is INVALID.

---

## Core Principle

Arabic is the TARGET language, not the instruction language.

- Children CANNOT read Arabic at the beginning.
- Instructions must NEVER rely on Arabic reading ability.
- UI language is the parent/child interface language (en/nl/de/sv).
- Arabic appears ONLY as learning stimuli (sound/shape), not as written instructions.

This pedagogy is aligned with:

- Phonological Awareness research (Ehri, Stanovich)
- Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)

## Phase Structure (MANDATORY)

### Phase A: Phonological Awareness (Levels 1–6)

ALLOWED:
- Hearing letter sounds
- Repeating sounds
- Seeing isolated letter shapes
- Visual distinction between letters
- Audio-only prompts
- UI-language instructions

FORBIDDEN:
- Words
- Reading
- Written Arabic questions
- Asking about letter position
- Meaning, vocabulary, or comprehension
- Any “choose the correct word” activity

Rule:
> No child should be able to answer correctly by reading.

---

### Phase B: Letter Form Awareness (Levels 7–12)

ALLOWED:
- Letter shapes (isolated → initial → final → medial)
- Matching same letters
- Building letters visually
- Still NO real words

FORBIDDEN:
- Real vocabulary
- Sentence fragments
- “Where is the letter in the word?”

---

### Phase C: Syllables and Controlled Units (Levels 13–16)

ALLOWED:
- CV syllables (با / بو / بي)
- Sound blending
- Audio-first activities

FORBIDDEN:
- Semantic questions
- Open-ended reading
- Multi-word meaning tasks

---

### Phase D: Reading with Meaning (Levels 17+)

ONLY here may:
- Words appear
- Meaning be discussed
- Position questions be asked
- Sentences be introduced

---

## Shibl (The Companion)

Shibl is NOT text feedback.

Shibl reactions must be:
- Visual (happy, encouraging, retry)
- Non-verbal
- Optional short sound cues

FORBIDDEN:
- Text like “Correct!” or “Try again”
- Written Arabic praise
- Any chat or explanation

---

## Absolute Prohibitions

❌ No Arabic instruction text before reading mastery  
❌ No exams before skill acquisition  
❌ No assumptions of reading ability  
❌ No shortcutting phases  

Any content violating this must be rewritten.
