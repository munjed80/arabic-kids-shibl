# Level 1 — Phase A (Phonological Awareness)

Level 1 has been rebuilt to follow the Phase A rules from `docs/PEDAGOGY.md`. Children cannot read Arabic yet, so every activity is audio-led and uses only the first three letter sounds.

## Scope and sequencing
- **Letters only:** /a/ (ا), /b/ (ب), /t/ (ت).
- **Three lessons:** one per sound, in that order.
- **Activities per lesson:** up to three short tasks that never rely on written Arabic instructions.

## Activity design principles
- **Audio first:** each lesson begins with a "listen and tap" task so learners connect the sound to the isolated letter shape.
- **Visual cues only:** letter shapes appear as choices; there are no words, sentences, or position questions.
- **Repetition without grading:** the final activity in every lesson invites the child to repeat the sound alongside Shibl’s visual encouragement; no text feedback or scoring is shown.
- **Interface language only:** prompts and descriptions are written in the chosen UI language so learners are never asked to read Arabic instructions.

## Compliance checklist
- No vocabulary, sentences, or reading tasks appear in Level 1.
- No written Arabic instructions, hints, or feedback are used; Arabic letters show up only as shapes to choose.
- Shibl reactions remain visual-only to align with Phase A guidance.
- Progression stays local and replayable; lessons can be repeated without exams or gating.
