# Level 1 — Phase A (Phonological Awareness)

Level 1 has been rebuilt to follow the Phase A rules from `docs/PEDAGOGY.md`. Children cannot read Arabic yet, so every activity is audio-led and uses only the first three letter sounds.

## Scope and sequencing
- **Letters only:** /a/ (ا), /b/ (ب), /t/ (ت).
- **Three lessons:** one per sound, in that order.
- **Activities per lesson:** up to three short tasks that never rely on written Arabic instructions.

## Activity design principles
- **Audio first:** each lesson begins with an auto-played letter sound; every activity keeps the same sound available via a single play icon (no written instructions).
- **Visual cues only:** letter shapes appear as choices; there are no words, sentences, or position questions.
- **Non-verbal reactions:** Shibl stays on screen with idle/happy/encourage animations; correct and incorrect answers trigger short, non-verbal sound cues instead of text.
- **Repetition without grading:** the final activity invites the child to repeat the sound with Shibl’s animation; no text feedback or scoring is shown.
- **Interface language only:** prompts and descriptions remain for parents, but inside the activity area learners see icons, motion, and shapes—never Arabic text instructions.

## Compliance checklist
- No vocabulary, sentences, or reading tasks appear in Level 1.
- All Level 1 activities carry letter-sound audio and start with playback or a play icon; distractors are visually similar shapes only.
- No written Arabic instructions, hints, or feedback appear inside the activity area; Arabic letters show up only as shapes to choose.
- Shibl remains visible and reacts with motion-only states paired with short sound effects for correct/incorrect answers.
- Progression stays local and replayable; lessons can be repeated without exams or gating.
